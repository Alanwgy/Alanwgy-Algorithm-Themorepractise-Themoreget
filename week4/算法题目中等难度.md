### 22. 三数之和  57
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.


**Example**
Example 1:

	Input:[2,7,11,15]
  Output:[]

Example 2:

	Input:[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
  Output:	[[-1, 0, 1],[-1, -1, 2]]

### 23. 适龄的朋友  1393
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A. Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?


**Example**
Example1

	Example 1:
	Input: [16,16]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.


	Example 2:
	Input: [16,17,18]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.

### 24. 颜色挑选 148
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Example**

Example1:

	Input : [1, 0, 1, 2]
  Output : [0, 1, 1, 2]
  Explanation : sort it in-place

### 25.二叉树中所有距离为 K 的结点 1506
We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node. The answer can be returned in any order.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input:
  {3,5,1,6,2,0,8,#,#,7,4}
  5
  2

  Output: [7,4,1]

  Explanation: 
  The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
  have values 7, 4, and 1.

Example 2:

	Input:
  {1,2,3,4}
  2
  1
  
  Output: [1,4]

  Explanation:
  The binary tree is like this:
      1
     / \
    2   3
   /   
  4   
  The node 1 and 4 is 1 away from 2.

### 26. 会议室 919
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  We need two meeting rooms
  room1: (0,30)
  room2: (5,10),(15,20)

Example 2:

	Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
  Output: 1
  Explanation: 
  Only need one meeting room

 ##数组
 ### 27.单调数列 1745
An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j]. An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].

Return true if and only if the given array A is monotonic.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: [1,2,2,3]
  Output: true

Example 2:

	Input: [1,3,2]
  Output: false

Find the next permutation in ascending order.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input:[1]
  Output:[1]

Example 2:

	Input:[1,3,2,3]
  Output:[1,3,3,2]
