### 29. 任务计划  52
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.


**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: tasks = ['A','A','A','B','B','B'], n = 2
	Output: 8
	Explanation:
	A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
        

Example 2:

	Input: tasks = ['A','A','A','B','B','B'], n = 1
	Output: 6
	Explanation:
	A -> B -> A -> B -> A -> B.

### 30. 搜索旋转排序数组  62
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.


**Example**
Example1

	Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=1, 
	Output: 2.
       

Example 2:

	Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=0, 
	Output: -1.

### 31. 买卖股票的最佳时机 149
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
**Example**

Example1:

	Input: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]
	Output: 1
	Explanation: You can buy at the third day and then sell it at the 4th day. The profit is 2 - 1 = 1

Example2:

	Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: You can buy at the 0th day and then sell it at the 4th day. The profit is 5 - 1 = 4

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: [0,1,0]
	Output: 0

Example 2:

	Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
	Output: 6

### 33. .连续子数组求和 402
Given an integer array, find a continuous subarray where the sum of numbers is the biggest. Your code should return the index of the first number and the index of the last number. (If their are duplicate answer, return the minimum one in lexicographical order)

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: [-3, 1, 3, -3, 4]
	Output: [1, 4]

Example 2:

	Input: [0, 1, 0, 1]
	Output: [0, 3]
	Explanation: The minimum one in lexicographical order.

 ### 34.分糖果 412
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value. Given array ratings representing all rating value of these children.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.

Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: [1, 2]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: Give the first child 1 candy and give the second child 2 candies.

Example 2:

	Input: [1, 1, 1]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: Give every child 1 candy.

### 35. 插入删除GetRandom O（1） 657
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

· insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
· remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present.
· getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.
**Example**
Example 1:

	// Init an empty set.
	RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();
	
	// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
	randomSet.insert(1);
	
	// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
	randomSet.remove(2);
	
	// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
	randomSet.insert(2);
	
	// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
	randomSet.getRandom();
	
	// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
	randomSet.remove(1);
	
	// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
	randomSet.insert(2);
	
	// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.
	randomSet.getRandom();
