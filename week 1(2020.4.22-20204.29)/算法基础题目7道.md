### 5.删除元素 172
Given an array and a value, remove all occurrences of that value in place and return the new length.

The order of elements can be changed, and the elements after the new length don't matter.

**Example**
Example 1:
	Input: [], value = 0
	Output: 0


Example 2:
	Input:  [0,4,4,0,0,2,4,4], value = 4

 ### 6.最长上升连续子序列 397
 Give an integer array，find the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

An increasing continuous subsequence:

Can be from right to left or from left to right.
Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.

**Example**
Example 1:

Input: [5, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation:
For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS  is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
Example 2:

Input: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS  is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.

### 7. 移动零 539
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example**
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12],
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 3, 1],
Output: [3, 1, 0, 0, 0].
