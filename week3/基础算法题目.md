### 16. 合并两个排序链表  165
Merge two sorted (ascending) linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new sorted list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the two lists and sorted in ascending order.

**Example**
Example1

	Example 1:
	Input: list1 = null, list2 = 0->3->3->null
	Output: 0->3->3->null


	Example 2:
	Input:  list1 =  1->3->8->11->15->null, list2 = 2->null
	Output: 1->2->3->8->11->15->null

### 18.比较含退格的字符串 1425
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

	1. 1 <= S.length <= 200
	2. 1 <= T.length <= 200
	3. S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
	Output: true
	Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".

Example 2:

	Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
	Output: true
	Explanation: Both S and T become "".

Example 3:

	Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
	Output: true
	Explanation: Both S and T become "c".

Example 4:

	Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
	Output: false
	Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".

### 19. N皇后问题 33
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other(Any two queens can't be in the same row, column, diagonal line).

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' each indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

**Example**
Example 1:
		Input:1
		Output:
	 	  [["Q"]]

Example 2:
	Input:4
	Output:
	[
  	  // Solution 1
	  [".Q..",
	   "...Q",
	   "Q...",
	   "..Q."
	  ],
	  // Solution 2	
	  ["..Q.",
	   "Q...",
	   "...Q",
	   ".Q.."
	  ]
	]

 ### 20.单词搜索 123
 Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input：["ABCE","SFCS","ADEE"]，"ABCCED"
	Output：true
	Explanation：
	[    
	     A B C E
	     S F C S 
	     A D E E
	]
	(0,0)A->(0,1)B->(0,2)C->(1,2)C->(2,2)E->(2,1)D

Example 2:

	Input：["z"]，"z"
	Output：true
	Explanation：
	[ z ]
	(0,0)z

### 21. 搜索二维矩阵 38
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix, return the occurrence of it.

This matrix has the following properties:

· Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
· Integers in each column are sorted from up to bottom.
· No duplicate integers in each row or column.

**Example**
Example 1:

	Input:
	[[3,4]]
	target=3
	Output:1

Example 2:

	Input:
	    [
	      [1, 3, 5, 7],
	      [2, 4, 7, 8],
	      [3, 5, 9, 10]
	    ]
	    target = 3
    Output:2
